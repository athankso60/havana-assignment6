					My favorite writing is the kind that clarifies something, or makes it approachable. Tutoring has had a similar effect for me in my own experience, so to work as a writing tutor is a great extension of that.</td>

					For me, the most important thing a college education can give is the ability to express my thoughts and memories in a way that will be valued. When every idea can be spoken in hundreds of different sentences, it's worth it to know how to find the best ones. That's why I'm in college.</td>
