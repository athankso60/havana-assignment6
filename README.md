This website is for the writing center's tutors at the UofR to recommend their students resources for their writing assignments such as citation and grammar help. There is also a page about the available writing fellows and their availability. 

# Ontology

* Each writing center helps with grammar
* Each writing center helps with citation

# Taxonomy 
* Basic Grammar Rules
* How To Cite

* Our Tutors
* Sign Up

# Choreography
The order is not only oragnized by alphabetical order but in the order of need. Meaning that the website's first priorirty is to help students with grammar and citation, so those two are first and ordered alphabetically. The last one is a page about tutors and students come here when they want to know the hours/schedule of a tutor and sign up to be notified for the application to be a writing tutor.

# CSS System

I have used the BootStrap framework. 
The CSS code has been divided into two parts. Firstly, I have the styling of HTML tags and then I have the styling of the classes. 
I have used the Grid Layout on the third page to enter the F pattern.
